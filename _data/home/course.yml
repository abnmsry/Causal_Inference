- p: <p>The course will draw upon examples from social sciences, public health, and other disciplies. We will illustrate applications of the approaches using R software. Students will be evaluatd and will deepen the understanding of the statistical principles underlying the approaches as well as their application in homework assignments, group presentations, a in-class midterm, and a take home final exam.</p>
