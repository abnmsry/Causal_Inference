- p: <p>Lots of the questions in scientic and policy research are often causal. In this class, we will introduce students to different theoretical frameworks from the perspectives of causal inference and introduce common statistical methods crucial to the practice of causal inference. </p>
- p: <p>In terms of theoretical frameworks, we will discuss potential outcomes, causal graphs, randomization, model-based inference, and causal mediation analysis.</p>
- p: <p>In terms of statistical tools, we will cover various methodologies including randomized experiments, matching, inverse probability weighting, dynamic causal models, and statistical methods for mediation analysis. We will also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these methods.</p> 
- p: <p>The course will draw upon examples from social sciences, public health, and other disciplines. We will illustrate applications of the approaches using R software. Students will be evaluated and will deepen the understanding of the statistical principles underlying the approaches as well as their application in homework assignments, group presentations, a in-class midterm, and a take home final exam.</p>
